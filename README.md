## Description
This full stack Adulting app allows the user to gain experience every time they do something that is considered “adulting”, like spending 30 minutes dealing with a customer service issue, answering email, etc. The user levels up and gain rewards as more points are accumulated. Milestones are achieved by doing things like getting a Costco membership, buying their own car, getting their own insurance, etc.

As a user I expect to
* Create an account
* Log in/log out
* Delete account
* Add experience from a predefined list of activities and acquire points
* Add custom activities and acquire points
* When a certain level of points are achieved received, I can level up
* When I level up I can pick rewards
